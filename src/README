This submission consists of three executables:

textgame runs the tetris games and prints the resulting JSON to stdout. Although it recognizes the required
command-line parameters, it ignores everything by -f and -p.

gfxgame visualizes the first game in a problem. It doesn't yet support the command-line options, it just takes
the problem file as an argument.

showboard just displays the initial board for a problem.

Although I used cabal to install some libraries, I didn't create a cabal package for the program. I added
the cabal statements as an option to Makefile - "make init"
