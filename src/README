This submission consists of two executables:
textgame runs the tetris games and prints the resulting JSON to stdout. It doesn't yet support the command-line
options, you just give it the name of the problem file as an argument.

gfxgame visualizes the first game in a problem. Like textgame, it doesn't yet support the command-line options,
it just takes the problem file as an argument.

Although I used cabal to install some libraries, I didn't create a cabal package for the program. I added
the cabal statements as an option to Makefile - "make init"
